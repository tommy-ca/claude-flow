### Unified Bridge Test Example

**Objective:** Test the unified maestro implementation with swarm coordination

**Status:** Requirements Clarification Phase
**Created:** 2025-07-30T01:50:30.003Z
**Swarm Task ID:** task-1753840230003-l8or5mcmg

**Advanced Features Tested:**
- Native swarm coordination
- Consensus-driven decision making
- Cross-agent memory sharing
- Real-time steering integration

**Swarm Integration Details:**
- **Coordinated by:** Maestro Swarm Coordinator
- **Agents:** requirements_analyst
- **Consensus:** Enabled (Byzantine fault-tolerant)
- **Memory:** Persistent cross-session storage

**User Stories:**
- As a user, I need seamless swarm coordination for complex workflows
- As a developer, I need reliable consensus mechanisms for design decisions
- As a stakeholder, I need transparent progress tracking and quality assurance

**Technical Requirements:**
- Native `HiveMind.submitTask()` integration
- Parallel agent execution with load balancing
- Fault-tolerant consensus validation
- Real-time memory synchronization

**Monitoring Commands:**
```bash
# Monitor swarm coordination
npx claude-flow hive-mind status

# Access collective memory
npx claude-flow memory query "test-unified-bridge requirements"

# Check consensus status
npx claude-flow consensus status
```

- Performance benchmarking
- Error handling and recovery
- Documentation accuracy

**Test Categories:**
1. **Functional Tests:** All commands work as documented
2. **Integration Tests:** Seamless hive-mind coordination
3. **Performance Tests:** Meet documented benchmarks
4. **Security Tests:** Proper validation and error handling
5. **Usability Tests:** Clear user experience and documentation

### Final Test Example

**Objective:** Production readiness validation

**Validation Criteria:**
- All workflow phases complete successfully
- Generated documentation meets quality standards
- Performance metrics within acceptable ranges
- No critical bugs or security issues
- User documentation is accurate and helpful

**Success Metrics:**
- **Completion Rate:** 100% of workflow phases
- **Quality Score:** ≥90% on all quality gates
- **Performance:** <2min per phase for standard complexity
- **User Satisfaction:** Clear, actionable documentation

## Using These Examples

### For Learning
1. **Start Simple:** Begin with the basic workflow test
2. **Progress Gradually:** Move to integration and advanced features
3. **Study Structure:** Notice the consistent 3-file pattern (requirements, design, tasks)
4. **Understand Flow:** Follow the phase progression and agent handoffs

### For Testing
1. **Validation:** Use these specs to test Maestro functionality
2. **Benchmarking:** Compare your results against documented expectations
3. **Debugging:** Use the structured approach to isolate issues
4. **Quality Assurance:** Verify all acceptance criteria are met

### For Development
1. **Templates:** Use as starting points for new specifications
2. **Patterns:** Follow the established structure and naming conventions
3. **Integration:** Understand how swarm coordination works in practice
4. **Best Practices:** Learn from the consensus and validation approaches

## Test Execution

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Run individual test workflows
npx claude-flow maestro create-spec integration-test "Test maestro-hive-mind integration"
npx claude-flow maestro generate-design integration-test
npx claude-flow maestro generate-tasks integration-test
```

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run test suites (when available)
node tests/maestro/run-all-tests.cjs
node tests/maestro/validate-maestro-native-hive-mind.cjs
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Benchmark workflow performance
npx claude-flow maestro performance-report
npx claude-flow maestro agent-stats
```

## Expected Results

Each test specification should generate:

1. **requirements.md** - Detailed requirements analysis with user stories
2. **design.md** - Technical design with consensus summary (if enabled)
3. **tasks.md** - Implementation task breakdown with dependencies
4. **Implementation artifacts** - Actual code and documentation

## Troubleshooting Test Issues

### Common Problems
- **CLI Access Blocked:** Use hive-mind commands as alternatives
- **Consensus Failures:** Lower threshold or disable for testing
- **Agent Timeouts:** Increase timeout values or reduce complexity
- **File Generation Issues:** Check permissions and directory structure

### Solutions
```bash
# Alternative testing approach using hive-mind
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind spawn "Execute maestro integration test workflow"

# Programmatic testing
node -e "import('./src/maestro/maestro-orchestrator.js').then(m => m.runTest('integration-test'))"
```

## Contributing Test Cases

To add new test specifications:

1. **Create Directory:** `docs/maestro/specs/your-test-name/`
2. **Follow Pattern:** Use the 3-file structure (requirements, design, tasks)
3. **Document Purpose:** Clear objective and acceptance criteria
4. **Test Thoroughly:** Verify all workflow phases complete
5. **Add to Examples:** Include summary in this document
