## 🎯 **EARS Requirements** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

### **Core Authentication Requirements**

**REQ-001**: WHEN a user provides valid email and password credentials, THE SYSTEM SHALL authenticate the user and generate a JWT token with user ID, role, and appropriate expiration (24 hours for customers, 7 days for artisans).

**REQ-002**: WHEN a user accesses protected resources, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the JWT token signature, check expiration, and authorize access based on user roles (customer, artisan, admin).

**REQ-003**: WHEN a JWT token expires or is invalid, THE SYSTEM SHALL reject the request with HTTP 401 Unauthorized and require re-authentication.

**REQ-004**: WHEN implementing password storage, THE SYSTEM SHALL use bcrypt hashing with salt rounds >= 12 to protect against rainbow table attacks.

**REQ-005**: WHEN a user registers an account, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate email uniqueness, enforce password complexity (minimum 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character), and send email verification.

### **Security Requirements**

**REQ-006**: WHEN implementing JWT tokens, THE SYSTEM SHALL use RS256 algorithm with public/private key pairs and include rate limiting (max 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP).

**REQ-007**: WHEN handling authentication errors, THE SYSTEM SHALL log security events but avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages to prevent user enumeration attacks.

**REQ-008**: WHEN implementing session management, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide secure logout functionality that invalidates tokens and supports token blacklisting for compromised tokens.

**REQ-009**: WHEN processing authentication requests, THE SYSTEM SHALL implement HTTPS-only communication and secure HTTP headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options).

**REQ-010**: WHEN storing user data, THE SYSTEM SHALL comply with GDPR requirements including data minimization, encryption at rest, and user consent management.

### **Role-Based Access Requirements**

**REQ-011**: WHEN an artisan authenticates, THE SYSTEM SHALL grant permissions to create/edit craft listings, manage inventory, view sales analytics, and access artisan-specific features.

**REQ-012**: WHEN a customer authenticates, THE SYSTEM SHALL grant permissions to browse crafts, make purchases, leave reviews, and manage personal profile and order history.

**REQ-013**: WHEN an admin authenticates, THE SYSTEM SHALL grant elevated permissions to manage users, moderate content, access system analytics, and configure platform settings.

**REQ-014**: WHEN implementing role checks, THE SYSTEM SHALL use attribute-based access control (ABAC) with resource-specific permissions rather than broad role-based access.

**REQ-015**: WHEN a user's role changes, THE SYSTEM SHALL update permissions immediately and invalidate existing tokens to prevent privilege escalation.

### **Integration Requirements**

**REQ-016**: WHEN integrating with the craft marketplace, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain user context across all platform features and support single sign-on (SSO) experience.

**REQ-017**: WHEN implementing OAuth integration, THE SYSTEM SHALL support Google and Facebook OAuth2 flows while maintaining the same security standards as native authentication.

**REQ-018**: WHEN handling authentication state, THE SYSTEM SHALL integrate with the global state management system and provide consistent user context across all application components.

## ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Functional Acceptance Criteria**

**AC-001**: Given valid user credentials, when authentication is attempted, then a JWT token is generated with correct claims (user_id, role, exp) and returned with HTTP 200.

**AC-002**: Given an expired JWT token, when accessing protected resources, then the request is rejected with HTTP 401 and appropriate error message.

**AC-003**: Given a new user registration, when password complexity requirements are not met, then registration fails with clear validation errors.

**AC-004**: Given multiple failed login attempts (>5 in 15 minutes), when authentication is attempted, then the IP is rate-limited with HTTP 429.

**AC-005**: Given a successful logout request, when the token is added to blacklist, then subsequent requests with that token are rejected.

### **Security Acceptance Criteria**

**AC-006**: Given password storage requirements, when passwords are hashed, then bcrypt with salt rounds >= 12 is used.

**AC-007**: Given JWT token validation, when tokens are verified, then RS256 algorithm with public key verification is used.

**AC-008**: Given authentication error scenarios, when errors occur, then sensitive information is not exposed in error messages.

**AC-009**: Given HTTPS requirements, when authentication endpoints are accessed, then all communication is encrypted with TLS 1.3.

**AC-010**: Given GDPR compliance, when user data is processed, then consent is obtained and data minimization is practiced.
