## üéØ **EARS Requirements** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

### **Core Requirements**

**REQ-001**: WHEN a developer initiates a feature specification, THE SYSTEM SHALL create a Kiro three-file structure (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) with automatic global context integration.

**REQ-002**: WHEN specifications are modified, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically synchronize with implementation code using bidirectional sync engine with "spec-wins" principle.

**REQ-003**: WHEN implementing Kiro workflow, THE SYSTEM SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing maestro architecture without breaking current functionality.

**REQ-004**: WHEN specs are created, THE SYSTEM SHALL enforce global context steering from product.md, structure.md, and tech.md files automatically.

**REQ-005**: WHEN code is generated from specs, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain 95%+ alignment with SOLID principles and Clean Architecture patterns.

### **Dogfooding Requirements**

**REQ-006**: WHEN implementing Kiro methodology, THE SYSTEM SHALL use Kiro methodology itself for its own development (dogfooding principle).

**REQ-007**: WHEN creating specifications, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate against existing maestro design patterns and maintain backward compatibility.

**REQ-008**: WHEN organizing specs, THE SYSTEM SHALL consolidate fragmented documentation into coherent Kiro structure.

**REQ-009**: WHEN updating existing specs, THE SYSTEM SHALL preserve existing functionality while enhancing with Kiro capabilities.

**REQ-010**: WHEN implementing new features, THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate Kiro workflow effectiveness through measurable metrics.

### **Integration Requirements**

**REQ-011**: WHEN integrating with maestro CLI, THE SYSTEM SHALL extend existing commands with Kiro-enhanced capabilities.

**REQ-012**: WHEN processing features, THE SYSTEM SHALL coordinate with HiveMind swarm architecture for multi-agent validation.

**REQ-013**: WHEN storing specifications, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain compatibility with existing docs/maestro structure.

**REQ-014**: WHEN implementing quality gates, THE SYSTEM SHALL achieve 95%+ specification-code alignment score.

**REQ-015**: WHEN synchronizing changes, THE SYSTEM SHALL complete bidirectional sync operations within 5 seconds for typical features.

## ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Functional Acceptance Criteria**

**AC-001**: Given a new feature request, when I run `npx claude-flow maestro kiro-spec <feature>`, then a complete Kiro three-file structure is created with global context integration.

**AC-002**: Given specification changes, when I modify requirements.md, then implementation code is automatically updated within 5 seconds maintaining 95%+ alignment.

**AC-003**: Given existing maestro functionality, when Kiro implementation is deployed, then all existing commands continue to work without breaking changes.

**AC-004**: Given global context files, when creating specifications, then all features automatically inherit and comply with global context constraints.

**AC-005**: Given quality thresholds, when generating code, then SOLID principles compliance is validated and enforced automatically.

### **Quality Acceptance Criteria**

**AC-006**: Specification-code alignment score: >95%
**AC-007**: Bidirectional sync latency: <5 seconds
**AC-008**: Quality validation time: <10 seconds  
**AC-009**: Global context compliance: >98%
**AC-010**: Backward compatibility: 100% existing functionality preserved
