## üéØ **EARS Requirements** (Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax)

### **Core Migration Requirements**

**REQ-001**: WHEN migrating maestro from SPARC to Kiro, THE SYSTEM SHALL completely remove all SPARC workflow dependencies and replace them with Kiro three-file specifications.

**REQ-002**: WHEN implementing the new Kiro-only maestro CLI, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide only Kiro commands (create, workflow, sync, validate) without legacy SPARC command support.

**REQ-003**: WHEN creating specifications with the new maestro, THE SYSTEM SHALL always generate the three-file Kiro structure (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) with EARS syntax and global context integration.

**REQ-004**: WHEN users run maestro commands, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear, simplified command interface focused solely on Kiro methodology without confusing legacy options.

**REQ-005**: WHEN implementing the simplified architecture, THE SYSTEM SHALL reduce code complexity by removing SPARC orchestrators, workflows, and phase management systems.

### **Simplification Requirements**

**REQ-006**: WHEN refactoring the maestro codebase, THE SYSTEM SHALL eliminate all SPARC-specific classes, methods, and configuration options to achieve maximum simplicity.

**REQ-007**: WHEN designing the new CLI commands, THE SYSTEM SHALL use intuitive, single-purpose commands that directly map to Kiro methodology steps.

**REQ-008**: WHEN generating specifications, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically include global context from steering documents without requiring manual configuration.

**REQ-009**: WHEN handling errors, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages focused on Kiro methodology best practices.

**REQ-010**: WHEN displaying help and documentation, THE SYSTEM SHALL present only Kiro methodology guidance without legacy SPARC references.

### **Dogfooding Requirements**

**REQ-011**: WHEN implementing this migration, THE SYSTEM SHALL use Kiro methodology to specify, design, and implement the migration itself as a demonstration of the approach.

**REQ-012**: WHEN creating the migration specification, THE SYSTEM SHALL follow the three-file Kiro structure to validate the methodology's effectiveness for complex system changes.

**REQ-013**: WHEN documenting the migration process, THE SYSTEM SHALL demonstrate how Kiro specs drive the actual implementation and serve as living documentation.

**REQ-014**: WHEN completing the migration, THE SYSTEM SHALL validate that the simplified Kiro-only maestro is more maintainable, usable, and effective than the hybrid approach.

### **Integration Requirements**

**REQ-015**: WHEN integrating with claude-flow ecosystem, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain compatibility with existing swarm coordination and hive mind features.

**REQ-016**: WHEN working with global context, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically reference product.md, structure.md, and tech.md steering documents in all generated specifications.

**REQ-017**: WHEN creating new specifications, THE SYSTEM SHALL place them in the organized specs/examples/ directory structure following Kiro conventions.

**REQ-018**: WHEN validating specifications, THE SYSTEM SHALL check alignment with Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and approved technology stack from steering documents.

## ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Functional Acceptance Criteria**

**AC-001**: Given the migrated maestro CLI, when I run `maestro help`, then I see only Kiro commands without any SPARC references.

**AC-002**: Given a feature request, when I run `maestro create feature-name "description"`, then three files are generated (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) with proper Kiro structure.

**AC-003**: Given an existing specification, when I run `maestro sync feature-name`, then I see current sync status with spec-code alignment percentages.

**AC-004**: Given a specification directory, when I run `maestro validate feature-name`, then I see global context compliance results.

**AC-005**: Given any maestro command, when it executes, then response time is <100ms and output is clear and actionable.

### **Quality Acceptance Criteria**

**AC-006**: Given the migrated codebase, when analyzed, then it contains 0 SPARC-related classes, methods, or configuration options.

**AC-007**: Given the new CLI code, when measured, then it has <50% of the original codebase complexity (measured by cyclomatic complexity).

**AC-008**: Given the simplified architecture, when tested, then all functionality works correctly with >95% test coverage.

**AC-009**: Given generated specifications, when reviewed, then they include proper EARS syntax, global context integration, and Clean Architecture patterns.
