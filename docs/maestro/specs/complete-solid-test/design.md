# complete-solid-test - Technical Design

## Overview
Technical design for complete-solid-test feature implementation.

## Swarm Coordination
- **Task ID**: task-1753985924113
- **Coordinated by**: Maestro Swarm Coordinator
- **Phase**: Research & Design
- **Agents**: design_architect, system_architect
- **Consensus**: Enabled

## Status
- **Phase**: Research & Design
- **Created**: 2025-07-31T18:18:44.113Z
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-31T18:18:44.113Z
- **Swarm Task**: task-1753985924113

## System Architecture
*This section will be populated by design architect agents through swarm coordination*

### High-Level Architecture
- [ ] System components and their relationships
- [ ] Data flow between components
- [ ] External system integrations

### Component Design
- [ ] Core components with responsibilities
- [ ] Interface definitions and contracts
- [ ] Dependency relationships

## Technical Specifications

### API Design
*API endpoints and data structures designed through collective intelligence*

### Database Schema
*Database changes and schema updates coordinated by swarm*

### Security Architecture
*Security analysis and requirements validated through consensus*

### Performance Design
*Performance goals and optimization strategies*

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation**: Core infrastructure and base components
2. **Core Features**: Primary functionality implementation
3. **Integration**: External system connections
4. **Optimization**: Performance and security enhancements

### Quality Gates
- [ ] Architecture review completed by swarm
- [ ] Security review passed through consensus
- [ ] Performance requirements validated
- [ ] API design approved by collective intelligence

## Swarm Integration
The design phase leverages collective intelligence:

```bash
# Monitor design coordination
npx claude-flow hive-mind status

# Access design patterns in collective memory
npx claude-flow memory query "complete-solid-test design patterns"
```

## Next Steps
1. **Review**: Validate design with stakeholders and swarm
2. **Consensus**: Achieve collective agreement on architecture (if enabled)
3. **Progress**: Run `npx claude-flow maestro generate-tasks complete-solid-test`
