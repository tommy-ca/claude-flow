# complete-solid-test - Requirements Specification

## Feature Request
Complete SOLID architecture integration test with all components

## Swarm Coordination
- **Task ID**: task-1753985924111
- **Coordinated by**: Maestro Swarm Coordinator
- **Phase**: Requirements Clarification
- **Agents**: requirements_analyst
- **Consensus**: Enabled

## Status
- **Phase**: Requirements Clarification  
- **Created**: 2025-07-31T18:18:44.111Z
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-31T18:18:44.111Z
- **Swarm Task**: task-1753985924111

## Requirements Analysis
*This section will be populated by the requirements analyst agent through swarm coordination*

### User Stories
- [ ] As a user, I need [specific functionality]
- [ ] As a developer, I need [technical requirements] 
- [ ] As a stakeholder, I need [business requirements]

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Core functionality requirements
- [ ] Integration requirements
- [ ] Performance requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Security requirements
- [ ] Scalability requirements
- [ ] Maintainability requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Requirements are clearly defined and measurable
- [ ] Use cases are documented with examples
- [ ] Non-functional requirements are specified
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained through consensus

## Swarm Integration
For advanced coordination, the swarm can be accessed via:

```bash
# Monitor swarm coordination
npx claude-flow hive-mind status

# Access collective memory
npx claude-flow memory query "complete-solid-test requirements"
```

## Next Steps
1. **Review**: Validate requirements with stakeholders
2. **Consensus**: Achieve swarm consensus on requirements (if enabled)
3. **Progress**: Run `npx claude-flow maestro generate-design complete-solid-test`
