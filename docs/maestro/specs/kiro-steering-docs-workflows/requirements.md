**REQ-012**: WHEN documenting architectural decisions, THE SYSTEM SHALL provide rationale, alternatives considered, and impact analysis.

### **Technical Standards Workflow Requirements**

**REQ-013**: WHEN establishing technical standards, THE SYSTEM SHALL specify development tools, frameworks, libraries, and deployment environments.

**REQ-014**: WHEN defining quality standards, THE SYSTEM SHALL set performance benchmarks, security requirements, and testing criteria.

**REQ-015**: WHEN managing technology evolution, THE SYSTEM SHALL track version compatibility, migration paths, and deprecation timelines.

### **Cross-Document Integration Requirements**

**REQ-016**: WHEN synchronizing steering documents, THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain bidirectional consistency between product, structure, and technical decisions.

**REQ-017**: WHEN generating specifications, THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically integrate relevant steering document context into requirements and design.

**REQ-018**: WHEN updating steering documents, THE SYSTEM SHALL propagate changes to dependent specifications and notify stakeholders.

## ‚úÖ **Acceptance Criteria**

### **Steering Document Creation**
**AC-001**: Given a new project initialization, when steering documents are created, then product.md, structure.md, and tech.md are generated with Kiro-compliant templates

**AC-002**: Given product vision input, when product.md is created, then it contains mission statement, strategic objectives, user personas, and success metrics

**AC-003**: Given architectural requirements, when structure.md is created, then it defines Clean Architecture layers, SOLID principles, and component relationships

**AC-004**: Given technology choices, when tech.md is created, then it specifies development tools, frameworks, quality standards, and performance benchmarks

### **Document Synchronization**
**AC-005**: Given steering document updates, when changes are made, then dependent specifications are automatically updated with new context

**AC-006**: Given cross-document references, when validation occurs, then consistency checks pass with >95% alignment scores

**AC-007**: Given specification generation, when maestro creates new specs, then steering document context is automatically integrated

### **Workflow Validation**
**AC-008**: Given steering workflow execution, when documents are processed, then Kiro methodology compliance is validated and reported

**AC-009**: Given quality gate validation, when steering documents are reviewed, then all defined quality criteria are met

**AC-010**: Given stakeholder notifications, when steering documents change, then relevant team members are notified with change summaries
