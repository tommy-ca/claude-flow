## Requirements Analysis
*This section will be populated by the requirements analyst agent through swarm coordination*

### User Stories
- [ ] As a user, I need [specific functionality]
- [ ] As a developer, I need [technical requirements] 
- [ ] As a stakeholder, I need [business requirements]

### Functional Requirements
