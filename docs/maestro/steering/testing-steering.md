# testing - Steering Document (Swarm Coordinated)

## Overview
Steering document for testing domain development with swarm coordination.

## Swarm Coordination
- **Created**: 2025-07-30T01:53:19.165Z
- **Coordinator**: Maestro Unified Bridge
- **Swarm Integration**: Active
- **Consensus**: Enabled

## Status
- **Created**: 2025-07-30T01:53:19.165Z
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-30T01:53:19.165Z
- **Domain**: testing
- **Coordination Mode**: Swarm-based collective intelligence

## Development Principles (Swarm Validated)
- Follow specs-driven development methodology with swarm coordination
- Maintain high code quality standards through collective intelligence
- Ensure comprehensive testing with swarm validation
- Document all architectural decisions through consensus

## Quality Gates (Collective Intelligence)
- Code review required for all changes through swarm coordination
- Minimum 80% test coverage validated by collective intelligence
- Security review for sensitive components with consensus validation
- Performance benchmarks must be met through swarm optimization

## Workflow Standards (Swarm Coordinated)
1. **Specification**: Create specification with swarm intelligence
2. **Design**: Generate technical design through collective intelligence
3. **Planning**: Break down into tasks using swarm coordination
4. **Implementation**: Execute with collective intelligence and consensus
5. **Validation**: Quality validation through swarm coordination

## Team Coordination (Hive Mind Integration)
- Use Maestro workflow for complex features with swarm coordination
- Leverage hive-mind for parallel development and collective intelligence
- Maintain collective memory of decisions and patterns
- Regular consensus checks for critical decisions
- Cross-agent communication and knowledge sharing

## Swarm Intelligence Features
- **Collective Memory**: Shared knowledge across all agents
- **Consensus Validation**: Critical decisions validated through swarm
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple agents working collaboratively
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous improvement through collective intelligence
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation through swarm coordination

## Success Metrics (Swarm Tracked)
- Feature delivery time with swarm coordination
- Code quality scores through collective intelligence
- Test coverage percentage validated by swarm
- User satisfaction ratings with consensus validation
- Swarm coordination efficiency and performance

## Swarm Integration Commands
```bash
# Monitor swarm coordination
npx claude-flow hive-mind status

# Access collective memory
npx claude-flow memory query "testing steering"

# Coordinate development
npx claude-flow hive-mind spawn "Coordinate testing development" --claude
```
