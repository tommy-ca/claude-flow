## Coordination Notes

### Dependencies Identified
The testing framework depends on several components that may need attention from other cleanup agents:

1. **Logger Configuration**: Tests failing due to logger initialization issues
   - Needs coordination with **LoggingSpecialist** agent
   - Critical for test execution in different environments

2. **Module Resolution**: Jest configuration issues with ES modules
   - Needs coordination with **BuildConfigOptimizer** agent
   - Affects test execution and module loading

3. **Interface Dependencies**: Missing exports and interface mismatches
   - Needs coordination with **InterfaceHarmonizer** agent
   - Critical for type safety and imports

4. **Core Components**: Dependencies on maestro/coordinator components
   - Needs coordination with **CoreArchitect** agent
   - Essential for integration testing

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Logger Integration**: Work with LoggingSpecialist to fix logger configuration for tests
2. **Build Configuration**: Work with BuildConfigOptimizer to resolve Jest/ES module issues
3. **Interface Alignment**: Work with InterfaceHarmonizer to fix missing exports
4. **Core Integration**: Work with CoreArchitect to ensure component availability
